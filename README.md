This library provides tools to generate quickly an object with its properties filled with random but meaningful values.

# Quick start

Let's see a small example of what the library can do:

```php
final class User
{
    /** @var int */
    private $id;

    /** @var string */
    private $username;

    /** @var string */
    private $password;
    
    /** @var \DateTime */
    private $dateAdd;
    
    /** @var \DateTime */
    private $dateUpdate;

    /** @var string */
    private $biography;
}
```

The `FixtureGenerator` can create an instance of this class:

```php
$fixtureGenerator = new \RichCongress\FixtureTestBundle\Generator\FixtureGenerator();
$user = $fixtureGenerator->generate(User::class, [
    'biography' => 'This was generated by the library',
]);
```

If we serialize the class in Json, it will give something like this:

```json
{
    // This is always null, we don't want to have a value for an id
    "id": null,

    // This is a random username
    "username": "john_doe",
    
    // This is a random password
    "password": "k&|X+a45*2[",

    // This is a random date between -200 days and today
    "dateAdd": "2019-12-03 11:07:02",

    // Notice the dateUpdate is always after the dateAdd
    "dateUpdate": "2020-03-04 18:57:41",

    // This is a hard value given during the generation, so any property can be quickly overriden
    "biography": "This was generated by the library"
}
```

```

# 2 Getting started

TODO ;)


# 3. Versioning

fixture-test follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). In short the scheme is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where
1. MAJOR is bumped when there is a breaking change,
2. MINOR is bumped when a new feature is added in a backward-compatible way,
3. PATCH is bumped when a bug is fixed in a backward-compatible way.

Versions bellow 1.0.0 are considered experimental and breaking changes may occur at any time.


# 4. Contributing

Contributions are welcomed! There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Here are some of the major ones:

* [Bug Reports](https://github.com/richcongress/fixture-test/issues): While we strive for quality software, bugs can happen and we can't fix issues we're not aware of. So please report even if you're not sure about it or just want to ask a question. If anything the issue might indicate that the documentation can still be improved!
* [Feature Request](https://github.com/richcongress/fixture-test/issues): You have a use case not covered by the current api? Want to suggest a change or add something? We'd be glad to read about it and start a discussion to try to find the best possible solution.
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/richcongress/fixture-test/merge_requests): Want to contribute code or documentation? We'd love that! If you need help to get started, GitHub as [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) on pull requests. We use the ["fork and pull model"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/) were contributors push changes to their personnal fork and then create pull requests to the main repository. Please make your pull requests against the `master` branch.

As a reminder, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
